  <h3><p><a href="https://rc24.xyz/services/television.html">The TV no Tomo Channel G Guide for Wii was
  a Japan-exclusive Channel that let you browse a TV guide. You could also use your Wii Remote as a TV remote using it,
  a feature that apparently would have been used on the Wii Menu but was scrapped. You could rate programs and send out
  alerts 30 minutes before a program is starting via an email or text. Also, you used a stamp to mark programs that interest you.
  This Channel used G-Guide from IPG. Also, HAL Laboratory, best known by making games in the Super Smash Bros. and Kirby franchise,
  helped make this Channel.</a></p></h3>
