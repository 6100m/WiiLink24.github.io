  <h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Network_Service_Database">A DSiWare
  application called Dokodemo Wii no Ma, now renamed Wii Room GO, could be downloaded free
  for Japanese users of the Nintendo DSi, and allowed them to download programs from Wii
  no Ma on the Wii onto the DSi, and then play them back. It also allowed users to download
  coupons onto the DSi, which can be scanned off the screen at a store.</a></p></h3>
