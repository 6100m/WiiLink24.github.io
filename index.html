    <h2>Why should I use WiiLink24?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You won't find another service like WiiLink24! WiiLink24 strives to bring back the Japanese exclusive Wii channels that were shut down many years ago. Namely <b>Wii no Ma</b>, <b>Demae Channel</b>, and <b>Digicam Print Channel</b>. With this service you can bring more life into your Nintendo Wii and use exclusive channels that you most likely haven't experienced yet.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Why does WiiLink24 exist?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Without a replacement service for these Japanese channels, they would be lost to time, never to be seen again. However, thanks to our work, future generations of players can experience these channels again!</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Is using WiiLink24 legal?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolutely! Our server development is completely clean of all copyrighted code and material. All code is written from the ground up. You will have no legal trouble from using our service.</li>
