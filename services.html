        Print Channel was a Wii Channel that was released only in Japan. It was created in
        collaboration with Fujifilm. In it, players are able to upload images onto the Wii
        via an SD Card in the same way they would with the Photo Channel. Next, they can pick
        their favorite photos and send them to Fujifilm, who'll process them (for a price) and
        send them to the player.</a></p></h3></td>

        a Japan-exclusive Channel that let you browse a TV guide. You could also use your Wii Remote as a TV remote using it,
        a feature that apparently would have been used on the Wii Menu but was scrapped. You could rate programs and send out
        alerts 30 minutes before a program is starting via an email or text. Also, you used a stamp to mark programs that interest you.
        This Channel used G-Guide from IPG. Also, HAL Laboratory, best known by making games in the Super Smash Bros. and Kirby franchise,
        helped make this Channel.</a></p></h3></td>
