Wii no Ma was a Japanese exclusive service by Nintendo and Dentsu. You could buy merch with your Mii&#39;s face on it, and you could even buy food! The service also allowed you to view exclusive rooms for sponsers. There was also a live TV service. The service ended in 2013. WiiLink24 is working on reviving it!
